# Feneel29

I attempted this challenge for several hours however, I kept getting stuck on how to use the api key to call requests from the yelp fusion. I do not have any previous experiences or knowledge with HTML or javascript. I could not attend the office hours since I had two tests the past week, so I did not have a way to ask an expert for their advice for this project. I attempted to use Node.js command prompt to make a local website by writing my code in sublime text with react. I know this does not meet the minimum requirements but I hope I am chosen to attend the summit so I can expand my horizons and learn software engineering.
